"""API
Application programming interface :These are the kind of functions created by other users /organization 
or even comapnies have started developing ,application using api approach to make the code module independent from each other.

JSON:
javascript object notation: The world most populaor data exchange format.
Json format: is actually an array of java script .
json format looks like list of dictionaries if we talk about 
collection of objects in python,

"""
# def add(a,b):
#     return a+b
# print(add)
# func=add   # func will be a function poinmter 

# f=lambda a,b:a+b  #f will be a function poinmter 
# r=f(5,6)    
# print(r)

'''Delegation Model
Suggest that if you want to perform some operation and want to design the code, but dont know the exct operation, and exact
operation you want to decide in future then you can use deligation model..

In Python even we can pass functions inside functions calling.
'''
# def func1(a):
#     print(a)

# def func():
#     pass
# func1(5)
# func1(func)  # a=func,a is the function pointer

# def add(a,b):
#     return a+b
# def sub (a,b):
#     return a-b
# def func1(a,b,func):
#     r=func(a,b)
#     return r
# u,v=5,6
# g=func1(u,v,add)
# print(g)
# # function are 1st class object...> matlb hai ki hum function ko as argument pas kar sakte hain
